# Text-Editor-PWA-Adam-Cleland
We are tasked with creating a progressive web application that will retain its functionality even when the user is offline. This project is a portfolio assignment for the Ohio State Full Stack coding bootcamp. We have been given starter code for the application and are tasked with refactoring it and turning it into a PWA.
