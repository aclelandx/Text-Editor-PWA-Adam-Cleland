# Text-Editor-PWA-Adam-Cleland

We are tasked with creating a progressive web application that will retain its functionality even when the user is offline. This project is a portfolio assignment for the Ohio State Full Stack coding boot camp. We have been given starter code for the application and are tasked with refactoring it and turning it into a PWA. The primary goal for this assignment was to create a webpack kit in order for the application to be bundled into a dist file for the public to utilize.
